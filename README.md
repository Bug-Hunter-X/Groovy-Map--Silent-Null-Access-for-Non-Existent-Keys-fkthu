This repository demonstrates a subtle issue in Groovy concerning Map access. When attempting to retrieve a value from a Groovy Map using bracket notation and the key doesn't exist, the operation silently returns null instead of throwing an exception. This can lead to hard-to-debug issues, particularly when null values are not explicitly handled. The `bug.groovy` file showcases this behavior, and `bugSolution.groovy` offers potential solutions.
